    <h1>What is Finance</h1>
    <p>Finance is a term that addresses matters regarding the management, creation, and study of money and investments. It involves the         use of credit and debt, securities, and investment to finance current projects using future income flows. Finance is closely   linked       to the time value of money, interest rates, and other related topics because of this temporal aspect.

        <b>Asset:</b> An asset is something of value such as cash, real estate, or property. A business may have current assets or fixed           assets.
        <b>Balance sheet:</b> A balance sheet is a document that shows a company’s assets and liabilities. Subtract the liabilities from           the assets to find the firm’s net worth.
        <b>Cash flow:</b> Cash flow is the movement of money into and out of a business or household.
        <b>Compound interest:</b> Compound interest is calculated and added periodically, unlike simple interest which is interest added           to the principal one time. This results in interest being charged not only on the principal but also on the interest that's                already accrued.
        <b>Equity:</b> Equity means ownership. Stocks are called equities because each share represents a portion of ownership in the              underlying corporation or entity.
        <b>Liability:</b> A liability is a financial obligation such as debt. Liabilities can be current or long-term.
        <b>Liquidity:</b> Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be converted to cash. Real estate isn't a very liquid investment             because it can take weeks, months, or even longer to sell.
        <b>Profit:</b> Profit is the money that's left over after expenses. A profit and loss statement shows how much a business has              earned or lost for a particular period.
