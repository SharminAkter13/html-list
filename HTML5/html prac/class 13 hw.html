		<h1><i>HTML Introduction</i></h1>
		<p style="color:yellow;">
		<b>HTML5</b> is the newest version of HTML. The term refers to two things. One is the updated 					<mark>HTML language </mark>itself, which has new elements and attributes. The second is the 					larger set of  technologies that work with this new version of HTML — like a new video format 					— and enable you to build more complex and powerful websites and apps.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p title="HTML5">
		HTML5 introduced several new semantically meaningful tags. These make it easier to write cleaner code that 		clearly delineates style from content, which is particularly important to users with assistive 					technologies like screen  readers.
